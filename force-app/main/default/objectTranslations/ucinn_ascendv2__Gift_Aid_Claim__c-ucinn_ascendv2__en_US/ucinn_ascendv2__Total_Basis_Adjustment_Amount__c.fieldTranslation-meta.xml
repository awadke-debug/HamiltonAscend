    <help><!-- Total for all adjustments in the Gift Aid Claim for which the Expected Claim Amount is calculated.  E.g., if a US$200 gift from &apos;last month&apos; is adjusted to US$500, the Adjustment Basis amount would be a net US$300 (US$500 - US$200) for calculating the claim.  This value can also be negative, e.g., &apos;last month&apos;, it was US$500, and this month, it has been adjusted to $US300, resulting in an Adjustment Basis Amount of US$-200 (US$300 - US$500). --></help>
