    <help><!-- This field establishes the maximum under-payment allowed to consider an installment to be paid. For example, if the installment is USD $100, and this value is 3%, then USD $97 will consider the installment to be paid; however, this is only valid for multi-currency environments and when a mix of currencies or a third currency is used to pay a pledge installment. Non multi-currency orgs will not be impacted by this field. --></help>
