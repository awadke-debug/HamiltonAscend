        <!-- Ambiguous — Multiple matching addresses found. Each candidate address will have its own precision level. A common &quot;ambiguous&quot; scenario is that the output will contain two versions of the same address — one with a company name and one without.
Verified — The address was verified, at the indicated precision level. NOTE: A verification_status of &apos;Verified&apos; does not necessarily indicate the address is valid or deliverable. For the address to be valid, address precision must be &apos;Premise&apos; or &apos;DeliveryPoint.&apos; -->
